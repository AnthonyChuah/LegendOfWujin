Text-based role-playing adventure
The Legend of Wujin



Story

Everyone has heard the tales concerning Wujin, the indomitable blademaster of the Wu-Dang Temple. He was a virtuous student of the sword, and rapidly became the mightiest and most respected swordsman of his era. Undefeated in every duel, it was said that his skin bore not a scratch of the thousands of battles he has fought. He was strong as the bear, swift as the cat, and was equipped with the finest armour of hardened steel and his storied longsword, "Rising Phoenix". 

However, his intense study of the martial arts led him to madness. His fall from grace was as swift as his meteoric rise, and soon he gathered brigands and barbarians to prey on the people of the Empire. Each day, hundreds of peasants lose their homes and possessions as his henchmen ravage the countryside. 

You are a young adventurer, keen to make your mark upon this world, and rid Imperial China of this menace. Will you succeed where others have failed? 



Navigation

The game features 5 rooms. See "map.jpg" for a map. Xian City is the central hub connecting all 4 wilderness zones. Each zone connects only to Xian City. 

South: Pearl River Delta: lowest-level area. 
East: Coast of the Yellow Sea: second-lowest-level area. 
North: Cold Steppes: second-highest-level area. 
West: Highland Plateau: highest-level area. 

All your commands should be in lower case, even though the game should be able to understand upper case versions. 

Type "north" or any cardinal direction to move. You can only move in directions for which exits exist: e.g. you can move north from Pearl River Delta to Xian City but you cannot move in any other direction. 

Moving from a wilderness zone runs the risk of ambush. 



Levelling Up: 

You can HUNT in Xian City to start with killing rats, the weakest enemy. You can HUNT in any of the 4 wilderness zones to kill stronger enemies. Note the level recommendations above. 

When you gain enough experience, you will automatically level-up. You do not have to initiate this process. This will happen after you gain experience past the threshold. Excess experience past the threshold does not count towards your next level. 

You will choose one attribute out of six [str, dex, int, maxhp, maxsta, maxmn] to improve when you gain a level. 



Attributes: 

Strength: increases melee damage and permits wearing heavier armour. 
Dexterity: increases defence, permits learning new skills, and improves the chance of fleeing. 
Intelligence: increases spell power and permits learning new spells. 
Max HP: increases maximum hit points (hp). If hp go down to zero, you die. 
Max Stamina: increases maximum stamina (sta). Stamina is used for performing skills. 
Max Mind: increases maximum mind (mn). Mind is used for casting spells. 
Experience: experience points (exp). 
Level: current experience level. 
To Next Level: the number of exp needed to gain the next level. 



Shopping: 

You can shop in town. Type "shop" when in Xian City to initiate the shopping process. Follow the instructions on screen. For a list of items and their statistics, see "items.jpg". 



Equipment: 

When you buy an item, it goes into your Inventory. Type "equip" to initiate the equipment process. You will then select the item you wish to equip. 



Training: 

You can train in town. Type "train" when in Xian City to initiate the training process. Follow the instructions on screen. 

You start with only the three basic attack skills: [atk, def, str]. To learn more, you must train. 

This is the list of skills, their stamina cost, dexterity requirement, and description. 

atk: 1 sta 0 dex: normal attack
def: 1 sta 0 dex: defensive attack has higher block chance
str: 1 sta 0 dex: aggressive attack has no block chance
shatter: 3 sta 12 dex: ignores enemy defence and scales with Strength
bash: 3 sta 14 dex: has a chance to deny enemy attack and chance scales with Strength

execute: 6 sta 24 dex: heavy attack more effective if enemy hp low and damage scales with Dexterity
flurry: 8 sta 26 dex: attacks 2 to 5 times and number of attacks scales with Dexterity

You start with no spells. To learn spells, you must train. 

This is the list of spells, their mind cost, intelligence requirement, and description. 

blast: 1 mn 10 int: basic attack
heal: 2 mn 14 int: heals hp and usable out of combat

Fighting: 

Combat is turn-based, and you can either flee, use a skill, or use a spell. 

Fleeing depends on your speed vs enemy speed. If you fail to flee, you miss your turn and enemy will attack you. 



Resting: 

Using "rest" in town will safely restore your status to maximum for 5 gold. 

Using "rest" out of town still requires 5 gold due to cost of supplies, and will restore 50% of your status, provided that you do not get ambushed. 

Rest in town! Keep in mind, however, that moving from a wilderness zone carries the risk of being ambushed. 



Victory: 

Once you believe yourself to be ready, type "challenge" in Xian City and you will seek out Wujin for a duel. You cannot flee from this duel. 

If you defeat Wujin in combat, then you win the game!
